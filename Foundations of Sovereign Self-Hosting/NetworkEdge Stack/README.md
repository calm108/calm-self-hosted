 Sovereign Edge Network Stack

This is a minimal, self-hosted edge networking stack that enables secure remote access to internal services using Cloudflare Tunnel and Traefik, paired with local DNS control using Pi-hole and Unbound.

📁 Contents

docker-compose-netedge.yml — Compose file defining the core network services

traefik.netedge.yml — Static configuration for Traefik (reverse proxy)

cloudflare.config.netedge.yml — Cloudflared tunnel config file

cloudflare.yourtunnelid.json — JSON credentials for Cloudflared tunnel

unbound.netedge.conf — DNS resolver config for Unbound

🚦 Service Overview

🌐 Cloudflared (Ingress)

Creates a secure, outbound tunnel to Cloudflare’s Zero Trust network.

Configured via cloudflare.config.netedge.yml

🔁 Traefik (Reverse Proxy)

Handles routing and TLS termination for incoming requests.

Uses manually installed Cloudflare Origin Certificates (wildcard) — not Let's Encrypt

Configured via traefik.netedge.yml and dynamic/ folder (optional)

🧱 Pi-hole (DNS + DHCP)

Network-wide DNS sinkhole and optional DHCP server.

Connected to casapilan (macvlan) for LAN-level visibility

Admin UI: http://192.168.1.24/admin/

🧠 Unbound (Recursive DNS Resolver)

Private DNS upstream for Pi-hole, running on the same macvlan network.

⚙️ Prerequisites

External Docker networks: casaproxy, casapilan

Static IPs reserved in your LAN for Pi-hole (192.168.1.24) and Unbound (192.168.1.50)

Cloudflare Origin Certificate + private key mounted to Traefik

🔐 TLS with Cloudflare Origin Certificate

This stack uses a Cloudflare Origin Certificate for TLS, mounted directly into Traefik via Docker Compose.

Your certs.yml should look like:

tls:
  stores:
    default:
      defaultCertificate:
        certFile: "/etc/traefik/certs/cloudflare-origin.pem"
        keyFile: "/etc/traefik/certs/cloudflare-origin.key"
  certificates:
    - certFile: "/etc/traefik/certs/cloudflare-origin.pem"
      keyFile: "/etc/traefik/certs/cloudflare-origin.key"

Mount this file in your docker-compose-netedge.yml:

volumes:
  - /path/to/certs:/etc/traefik/certs
  - /path/to/certs.yml:/etc/traefik/dynamic/certs.yml

This avoids Let's Encrypt and ensures secure access via Cloudflare Tunnel.

Every exposed service is configured using Docker labels for Traefik. Example (for Ghost):

labels:
  - traefik.http.routers.blog.rule=Host(`blog.chrisalmida.com`)
  - traefik.http.routers.blog.entrypoints=websecure
  - traefik.http.routers.blog.tls=true

🧑‍🔧 Macvlan Setup for casapilan

To allow containers like Pi-hole and Unbound to behave like separate devices on your LAN, this stack uses a macvlan network.

✅ Create the macvlan network manually:

docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.1.1 \
  --ip-range=192.168.1.192/28 \
  -o parent=eth0 \
  casapilan

💡 Note: Replace eth0 with your actual network interface (e.g., enp3s0, ens18). Run ip a to confirm.

🔒 Isolated from Host

Containers on a macvlan network cannot communicate with the Docker host by default. If you need API access (e.g., to Pi-hole), set up a proxy container on a separate host.

🚀 Deploy

docker compose -f docker-compose-netedge.yml up -d

🧰 Extras

Cloudflare Tunnel config reference

Traefik documentation

Pi-hole + Unbound guide

🧼 Sanitization

All secrets, passwords, emails, tunnel IDs, and volume paths have been replaced with placeholders like:

ENTER_YOUR_CF_API_TOKEN_HERE
ENTER_YOUR_PIHOLE_PASSWORD_HERE
ENTER_YOUR_PWD_HERE

Replace these before deployment.
